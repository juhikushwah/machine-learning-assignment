DATA: Download the Dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data

As the link suggests, this is a part of Kaggle Comptetition. This dataset is used to predict if a patient has diabetes or not given various parameters. It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable-Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, age, etc.

(I have uploaded a CSV file for the same in this repo.) 

Used Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and 3-nn classifiers (library) to train on the training sets and compute training and validation errors for each fold.
